October 2014
------------

Started as a [SUSE hackweek project](https://hackweek.suse.com/projects/368)
to evaluate using the [boost graph library](www.boost.org/libs/graph/) as the
main container for storage devices. Initially named libstorage-bgl-eval.


February 2015
-------------

Ability to install a simple bootable system using a compatibility layer for
the libstorage API with almost unchanged YaST.


February 2016
-------------

Approved as successor for libstorage and renamed from libstorage-bgl-eval to
libstorage-ng.


November 2016
-------------

Ability to install a simple bootable system without the compatibility
layer. Instead the most important YaST modules required for the installation
have been [adapted to the libstorage-ng
API](https://lists.opensuse.org/yast-devel/2016-11/msg00043.html).


September 2017
--------------

Included in SLE 15 Alpha 4, replacing legacy libstorage.
